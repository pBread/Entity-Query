# Motivation

Searching/filtering/finding records is one of the most common frontend tasks. And also, one of the most common causes of bugs and performance issues â€“ especially w/frameworks like React where the UX is driven by state.

MoSearch is a small utility designed to simplify how developers search/filter/find in a performant and unobtrusive way.
